This is a python project compatible with Windows. It includes a .exe file in the dist folder to easily run the program. An integer can be inputted and a dynamic graph of the Collatz sequence is computed and shown.

The Collatz sequence of an integer greater than 1 can be found by repeatedly applying the following:
- If the number is even, divide by 2.
- If the number is odd, multiply by 3 and then add 1.
This sequence, with every number ever attempted, always goes to 1.  Called the "simplest impossible math problem", the Collatz Conjecture is still unproven.  This tool provides a dynamic visual of the Collatz sequence of a number.
